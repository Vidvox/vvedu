# The cut

A cornerstone of cinematic technique is the ‘cut’. How and when you choose to go from one scene or subject to the next greatly influences the narrative arc of your sequence. One of the oldest examples of this is called the “Kuleshov Effect.” We call these ‘reaction shots.’

We refer to a collection of cuts, or edits, as a montage or assembly. Alfred Hitchcock is a master of using reaction shots, scale and the movie’s score to an exacting effect.

As a visual performer, you will be something like a live editor.
