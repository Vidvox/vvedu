# About This Class

In the late 90's and early 2000's, as the world of DJing evolved beyond simple curation of music with specializations like scratching, sampling, remixing and the like, so have visual artists expanded their set of tools and techniques for live performance and production to include many similar concepts.

Today someone who is a VJ might appear to be something more akin to a video instrumentalist or visualist, someone who creates and manipulates images in ways similar to how a modern musician works with sound.

Like the world of professional music, modern live video art has developed several distinct sub-genres of VJing. Some of the most commonly encountered today including, show design, media remixing, live cinema, interactive installations, film and music video  production, and the creation of digital art objects.

While these are very different fields, there is often a large overlap in the skill sets involved. Many VJs eventually find themselves specializing in one or more of these areas, or at least assisting on projects that fall outside of the scope of traditional production techniques. Likewise many people who start in these fields may find VJing to be something they want to learn more about.
