# Lesson 2: Rhythmic Sequence

As a visual performer, you will be something like a live editor. Learning how to cut between images based on rhythmic structure will aid in the ordering of information in a compelling way. 

We’re creating rhythm almost immediately after we begin performing -- it’s inevitable once multiple elements appear on the screen. We’d like that rhythm to be a little more planned instead of placing elements randomly though. There are three primary types of rhythm you can plan for.

* Regular rhythm: Intervals between images are the same in duration (i.e., one second per image)
* Progressive rhythm: The duration of images are changed over a progression, getting faster towards the end (2 sec, 1 sec, ½ sec, and so on)
* Flowing (organic) rhythm: Occurs when the images or intervals are organic, used to create a feeling of visual polyphony.
