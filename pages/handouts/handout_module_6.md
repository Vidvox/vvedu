# Show Production

It’s showtime! 

The final piece/performance is a culmination of the experience and knowledge gained over the semester. It must utilize at three techniques demonstrated during the course—incorporating motion and sound—with a written statement as to why those techniques were used and the dramatic intent. 

This is also the opportunity to include their interests in other disciplines, and to further develop visuals which reflect their own interests.

Over the course of this section, students will work towards completing a single project that will count as the final for this course. It can take one of three forms:
- Using a selected piece of audio or musical collaboration, create and perform a three minute audio/visual piece. 
- Using a selected piece of audio or musical collaboration, create and perform a three minute demo reel showcasing your work from the semester.
- Prepare for a 15 minute live performance piece using at least three of the techniques covered over the semester.

Students can work on their own, or in a small group for this project by request at the discretion of the professor.

As we get ready for the final project and performance we will also begin to have a more in depth look at the world of show production and how to prepare for your first big events.

## Lesson 1: Pre-Production

Using our prepared mood boards and storyboards as a starting points we begin to gather and create the individual elements for the final project / performance. This can take the form of media files such as movies, still images, animated gifs and interactive generators, custom FX, as well as any physical portions that will be needed, such as projection surfaces.

During the pre-production phase it can often be useful to work with other artists and technicians; this can help with filling in knowledge gaps and for being able to accomplish more tasks before a deadline.

## Lesson 2: Technical Riders and Contracts

When preparing to perform a show two of the most important documents an artist might prepare are the technical riders and contracts, which can be used to help define the working relationships with other people involved in the project.

As the name suggests, the technical rider includes the everything related to the more technical aspects of your setup, often including detailed descriptions of spacial, electrical and other requirements for a venue, wiring diagrams demonstrating how each piece of equipment should be connected, and contact information of anyone who might need to be reached for any follow up questions.

Contracts can come into play to help specify the scope of a working relationship, whether it is a collaboration or work-for-hire. As an artist you may find yourself on many different sides of contracts. In one situation, you may have a client who is paying you to do certain tasks, such as perform live at an event. In another, you may hire someone else to help with the preparation of materials. For collaborations it can often be useful to have a contract in place to clarify the responsibilities of each individual before a project begins, and specify who has future rights to continue development after the initial work has been completed.

Another detail we will look at in this lesson are the various jobs that are crucial to the lifetime of a show production beyond the artists and performers themselves. In particular, visual artists and VJs may find themselves working closely with, or assuming the role of, the lighting designer (the LD) for a show. The LD also deals with light, color, themes, feelings and time, with many of the same intentions as the video side of a performance, and there are an enumerable number of ways to use the two techniques together to reach the level of epic event production.
