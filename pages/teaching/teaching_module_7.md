## Lesson 1: Collaborating with Musicians

[Handout: Generative Patterns](/handout_module_4.html)

In the case where visuals and lighting are being performed live along with music, there is the possibility for both sides to respond and react, in the way the members of a band can improvise or riff off each other, or create an informal jam session to try out new ideas.

When collaborating with musicians directly on the creation of new work, visual artists have an opportunity to influence the way that the sound and imagery are connected in time and feeling. For live performances this also allows for the possibility of sharing timecode and other control information between systems for an added level of synchronization.
