# Module 1: Cinematic Technique

Choosing images is the central undertaking of video design. The audience will decode these images, so how will they make use of all the meanings? Too many connotations can result in anxiety, but this can be resolved. We can use major cinematic devices to clarify the emotion and meaning in audio / visual performance.

In our first Module, The Cinematic Technique, students will learn a range of basic editing principles, developing their timing skills as they develop sensitivity to successiveness, temporal order and simultaneity. They will be able to contrast clock-time with subjective time, duration, temporal continuity, the feelings of anticipation and expectation, and the shifting of temporal perspectives.

Students will work with software applications – alone and in combination – as they develop the design skills needed to work with and between still and sequential time-based projects. Students will be introduced to a wide range of digital tools, concepts and experiences that will enable them to create, acquire, manipulate, animate and distribute digital content across multiple platforms and outputs. 

## Lesson 1: The Cut

[Handout 1: The Cut](/handout_module_1.html)

A cornerstone of cinematic technique is the ‘cut’. How and when you choose to go from one scene or subject to the next greatly influences the narrative arc of your sequence. One of the oldest examples of this is called the “[The Kuleshov Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuleshov_effect).” We call these ‘reaction shots.’ Alfred Hitchcock is a master of using reaction shots, scale and the movie’s score to an exacting effect.

* Recording clips on phone and copying to computer to use
* Creating and recording Kuleshov mixes in VDMX
* Recording clips on phone and copying to computer to use
* Uploading recordings

### Discussion:
* Silence vs Music

## Lesson 2: Rhythmic Sequence

[Handout 1: The Cut](/handout_module_1.html)

As a visual performer, you will be something like a live editor. Learning how to cut between images based on rhythmic structure will aid in the ordering of information in a compelling way. 

We’re creating rhythm almost immediately after we begin performing -- it’s inevitable once multiple elements appear on the screen. We’d like that rhythm to be a little more planned instead of placing elements randomly though. There are three primary types of rhythm you can plan for.

* Regular rhythm: Intervals between images are the same in duration (i.e., one second per image)
* Progressive rhythm: The duration of images are changed over a progression, getting faster towards the end (2 sec, 1 sec, ½ sec, and so on)
* Flowing (organic) rhythm: Occurs when the images or intervals are organic, used to create a feeling of visual polyphony.

## Lesson 3: Montage

We refer to a collection of cuts, or edits, as a montage or assembly. It was introduced to cinema primarily by Sergei Eisenstein, and early Soviet directors used it as a synonym for creative editing. From the 1930s to the 1950s, montage sequences often combined numerous short shots with special optical effects (fades, dissolves, split screens, double and triple exposures) dance and music.
