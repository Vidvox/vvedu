# Introduction to Montage Overview

In his essay “[The Photographic Message](https://artofcreativephotography.com/essay/the-photographic-paradox-roland-barthes/),” Roland Barthes sees the newspaper as “a complex of concurrent messages with the photograph as centre and surrounds constituted by the text, the title, the caption, the layout and ... by the very name of the paper.” According to Barthes, a newspaper is a sea of text with pictures in the middle of it. What live performance, but a sea of text or music with pictures in the middle of it? 

Choosing images is the central undertaking of video design. The audience will decode these images, so how will they make use of all the meanings? We can use major cinematic devices to clarify the emotion and meaning in audio/visual performance.

A central technique of VJ’ing is the remix, a collection of cuts. In cinema, we refer to a collection of cuts, or edits, as a [montage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_montage_theory) or assembly. Montage was introduced to cinema primarily by [Sergei Eisenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein) in the 1920s, and early Soviet directors used it as a synonym for creative editing. 

In our first module, Montage, you will learn a range of basic editing and layering principles, developing their timing skills as they develop sensitivity to successiveness, temporal order, and simultaneity. These will be used to contrast clock-time with subjective time, duration, temporal continuity, the feelings of anticipation and expectation, and the shifting of temporal perspectives as it relates to content.

## Lesson 1: The Cut

[Handout: The Cut](/handout_module_2.html)

One of the oldest examples of montage editing is called the “Kuleshov Effect.” This experiment demonstrated cinema’s unique capacity as an art form to conjure emotional reactions from the relationship between indexical images. 

You will use this cornerstone of editing as your first VJ’ing exercise, eliciting different responses and correlations by strategically ordering content. Finally, you will experiment with different ‘soundtracks’ to greater influence emotion and meaning.

## Lesson 2: Rhythmic Sequence

[Handout: The Rhythmic Sequence](/handout_module_2.html)

Eisenstein's montage theories are based on the idea that montage originates in the "collision" between different shots in an illustration of the idea of thesis and antithesis. His collisions of shots were based on conflicts of scale, volume, rhythm, motion (speed, as well as direction of movement within the frame), as well as more conceptual values such as class.

Rhythmic editing is when the relations between shots function to control visual pace and meaning. A shot's physical length corresponds to a measurable duration. Rhythmic function occurs when several shot lengths form a discernable pattern. For instance, equal length between cuts will create a steady metrical beat.

You’re creating rhythm almost immediately after you begin performing -- it’s inevitable once multiple elements appear on the screen. In this case, we’d like that rhythm to be a little more planned, instead of placing elements randomly. There are three primary types of rhythm you can plan for:

* Regular rhythm: Intervals between images are the same in duration (i.e., one second per image)
* Progressive rhythm: The duration of images are changed over a progression, getting faster towards the end (2 sec, 1 sec, ½ sec, and so on)
* Flowing (organic) rhythm: Occurs when the images or intervals are organic, used to create a feeling of visual polyphony. Think VJ’ing to wind chimes.

## Lesson 3:

[Handout: Cinéma Pur](/handout_module_2.html)

From the 1930s to the 1950s, montage sequences often combined numerous short shots with special optical effects (fades, dissolves, split screens, double and triple exposures) dance and music. 

The [Cinéma Pur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cin%C3%A9ma_pur) movement was to create a cinema that focused on the pure elements of film like motion, light, visual composition, and rhythm. It was begun by European filmmakers [René Clair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Clair), [Fernand Léger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernand_L%C3%A9ger), [Hans Richter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Richter_(artist), [Viking Eggeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Eggeling), [Walter Ruttmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Ruttmann), [Man Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Ray) and [Marcel Duchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp). Often these abstract art films showed patterns in motion, creating visually pleasing or intriguing compositions that reflected cinema’s essential power. Films like Man With A Movie Camera, Ballet Mécanique, Symphony Diagonale, and Berlin: Symphony of a Great City are quintessential examples of Cinéma Pur. 

For this exercise, you will experiment with the layering of indexical material to create new visual associations and meanings using a select range of optical effects. Experiment superimposing contrasting imagery — abstract and realistic, light and dark, graphic and photographic, fast and slow, human and machine. Be prepared to discuss the emergence of this third image with a statement of intent.

- - - Reset fade curves to be full opacity for each layer in the middle (default for this template)
3. Use the section preset for the mixer to demonstrate auto mixer by data-sources
4. Technique tip: Using longer clips as a backing track and mixing in elements over it

OR

Steps starting from new project,
1. Prepare layer arrangement
- Add a layer to the project
- Rename Layer 1 to Left and Layer 2 to Right
- Open Layer Src controls and Layer FX windows for each layers
- Use the 'Use Source' menu to select sample media for each layer
2. Prepare the plugins
- Switch to the Plugins section of the Workspace Inspector
- Using the + button menu:
- - Add a second media bin
- - - Set the second media bin to target Layer 2
- - - Add provided media files set 1 to project
- - - Create a new page in bin 2 and add media files set 2
- - Add 1 or 3 preview windows
- - - Set the first preview to the main output
- - - If using 3 previews, set preview's 2 & 3 to layers 1 and 2
- - Add the Two Channel Mixer plugin
- - - Set the left side to Layer 1 and the right side to Layer 2
3. Arrange plugin and layer windows
- Optional: Demonstrate more than one window arrangement

- Create a section preset to store the automated state
- Demonstrate adjusting the duration / rate of the LFO
6. Technique tip: Using longer clips as a backing track and mixing in elements over it

#### Layer Blending / Composition Modes, Alpha and Transparency

1. Continuing from above, set the mixer to the mid-point so that the layers are evenly mixed at full opacity
2. Demonstrate blend / composition modes
- Switch to the Layers section of the Workspace Inspector
- Inspect the layer composition controls for Left layer
- - Note that layers render from bottom to top; only the composition mode of the Left layer is needed here
3. Over Mode and Alpha / Transparency
- Switch to OpenGL Over mode
- - Note that Left layer now completely covers the Right layer
- - Switch to using content that has transparency
- - - Movie with alpha channel
- - - Interactive generator with transparency background
- - - Interactive Checkerboard.fs generator, adjusting the alpha of the each color
- Note that OpenGL Add / Over modes are most efficient, but all layers within a group must be using them
4. Composition Modes
- Switch composition mode to GLSL > 'Difference.fs'
- Switch composition mode to GLSL > 'Multiply Blend.fs'

#### Masking

1. What is masking?
- Masking is the process of adding alpha channels to an existing stream
- Masking category of FX includes Layer Mask, Chroma Mask and Shape Mask
2. Luma Key examples 
- Load 'Luma Key Example' template
- - Note that the 'Layer Mask' FX is applied to 'Front' and only the sections where the 'Mask' layer is white show through
- - Demonstrate basic Layer Mask controls
- - - Use 'bright' control to transition between 'Front' and 'Background' being totally visible, reset to middle when finished
- - - Switch 'Contrast between 1.0 and -1.0 to show inverting
- - - Note that other controls can be used when stacking multiple masking FX
- - From the Workspace Inspector > Layers, inspect the Mask layer and note that the layer is hidden, but can still be previewed and used as a mask
- Load the 'Luma Key Mixer' example template
- - Add the hi-con clips for the luma key bin
- - - Hi-con, or 'high contrast' clips often work well for luma keys
- - Note that Layer Masks and Two Channel Mixers can be used together to create advanced setups
3. Chroma Key example
