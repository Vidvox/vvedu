# About These Documents

## The Course

This course will be organized around introducing students to a wide range of methods in constructing screen and projection based media. A class will typically commence with an introduction and discussion of a concept and its related applications followed by a group exercise in learning a new technology, tool, or methodology.

Weekly assignments will be given. They will typically relate to a worksop and will usually extend into longer projects. Critiques will take place at the end of every project, and students’ active engagement forum discussion will play a vital role in establishing an atmosphere of collaboration and shared learning.

More information can be found on the [Course Syllabus](/vvedu/course_syllabus.html) page, which should be provided to students.

### Module Design

This set of coursework is designed for educators and students to learn about the techniques being used to create live visual performances and investigate how these same skills can be applied to innovate on traditional forms of video production.

The lesson plans provided are broken up into separate modules that can be followed in order or put together in sub-collections that best fit with the focus for your class.

#### Teacher Lesson Plans

For each module, broken up by, lesson you will find the following resources:
* **Lesson description**: A short introduction describing the concepts, exercises and goals associated with the lesson.
* **Handout**: A link to the matching student handout that can be provided to the class which includes notes and useful reference links from the lesson.
* **Lecture notes**: Starting points for material that can be used to explain lesson topics in the form of a lecture or presentation.
* **Demonstrations**: A list of suggested in class lessons that you, the teacher, should walk-through as demonstrations for the students to observe or follow along.
* **Exercises**: A list of suggested tasks that students can work on in class individually or in small groups. Often these are variations on the demonstrations, with the idea that students repeat the techniques that were just explained by the teacher.
* **Discussion**: Ideas for guided group conversations based on topics related to the lesson.
* **Special equipment**: In some cases it can be useful to have some special equipment to perform an in class demonstration or exercise. Where included these notes can serve as a reminder to acquire these items.

Depending on the time constraints and limitations of your demonstration equipment, some of the demonstrations and in class exercises may not be possible. Use your best discretion when it comes to  which parts best fit with your classroom capabilities.

It is recommended that you go through the materials from each module yourself, including the student handouts, in advance of each lesson as a refresher.
